            <p>
                In 1872, the Grant administration established Yellowstone National Park in modern day Montana and Wyoming 
                "as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people". Almost 150 years later, 
                the United States has established over 400+ sites of cultural, historic, military, and environmental importance 
                which make up the National Park System. Individual, free-of-change stamps are available in every National Park's ranger station 
                to record the park name and date of attendence, and Passport to Your National Parks Program began in 1986 as a means to 
                collect stamps and educate the public of our nations many National Parks
